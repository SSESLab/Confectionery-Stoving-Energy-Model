# Code for Energy model and Optimization
The Python notebook file may be used to model a generic confectionery stove in different weather climates.  The model may evaluate different amounts of circulation air and outside air.  Additionally, the user may run a multi-objective optimization on the system to find the optimal solution set.

Instructions (Python File):
1) Download the anaconda notebook Stove-Oven_2019.05.11.ipyn
2) Download the desired weather file an save it in the 'Documents' folder
3) Run the code.  Be sure to have all helper libraries installed

User may run the code using for multi-objective optimization or as a single solution set.  To use a single solution set 'un-comment' code as notatated and comment out the multi-objective optimization code
